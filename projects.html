      <h3>Personal Page</h3>
      <p>In order to have some kind of curriculum with all my information easy to access and easy ti update I created this Website/Personal page
      that easly keeps track of anything I do, from what I study to what Projects I'm in and what sports I'm currently practicing.</p>
         <a href="https://github.com/pedrovleite/pedrovleite.github.io"  style="color:white">GitHub Link - Personal Page</a>
      <br>
      <p>It started with a simple template from our friends at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_make_a_website.asp" style="color:white">w3schools.com</a></p>
      <center>
      <img src="/media/website_project/first_print.png" alt="Apresentação" style="width:70%" class="center">
      </center>
      <p>After playing around with it for a while and putting all the inforation in the same page I noticed that the website was getting too long,
         and it was difficult to search for the more important information. I started to devide the website in small pages and costumizing a little
          the navbar and the "About Me" section. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The navbar was one of the big problems, I wanted something that could be read in the PC (of course) but since everyone now reads everything in small screens, it was my goal to build something that you could visualize in
      any device. Nothing like a night without sleep some coffee and dark tea to get to know css and javascript and create a nav bar that could collapse in screen with less than 800 pixels.</p>
      <center>

      </center>
      <br>
      <p>In addition to that I painted all black 'cause "Praise Dark Mode" and because I'm a big fan of Batman too.</p>
      <!-- <br> -->
      <p>One personal and funny thing I added too was a carousel of funny quotes about me from random people like partners, college professors and friends.</p>
      <!-- <br> -->

      <img src="/media/website_project/website_carousel.gif" alt="Apresentação" style="width:70%" class="center">
      </center>
      <p>That's all, the rest is just small webpage costumization and filling with information.</p>

      <h3>Meme Movie Database (In development with Manuel Lamas)</h3>
      <p>This project started with the good thing that every frienship should have "meme sharing" After a while
      we noticed that the memes we share usually came from the same movies (like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars),
      movies that had a high score in Imdb Ratings. So we  created the hypothesis, maybe the great movies
      (and here we defined great as higher in rank) have the greater number of memes.</p>

      <h3>Drunk Homer Project</h3>
      <p>This project simulates a random walk of a character (in this case Homer Simpson), the objective was to simulate and study the time
      it took for Homer to get from Moe's to his house (to a angry Marge) after a night drinking.</p>
